## About

Neu UI started life as a small side project exploring UI component design and development using neumorphic design.

The style was originally conceptualised by [Alexander Plyuto](https://dribbble.com/alexplyuto) in late 2019 and "neumorphism", a mixture between skeumorphism and material design, was coined by Michal Malewicz shortly afterwards.

For further information about the design, it's worthwhile taking a look at Alexander Plyuto's guide [here](https://www.figma.com/file/J1uPSOY5k577mDpSfGFven/Neomorphism-Guide-2.0-%7C-Original?node-id=26580%3A1425).

The initial components have now been converted and extended to include a whole suite of initial controlled form and card components into a React library. It uses React under the hood, Storybook as a tool to visualise the components and Styled Components to well, style the components.

We are looking for anyone interested in contributing, for further information check out the contribution section below.
